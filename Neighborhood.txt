INTRODUCTION

Aim of the project is to predict the desired location for setting up a new business.
The Business is a coffee shop chain that is aiming to expand and needs guidance in selecting between the two locations.

The information will be in the form of locations of existing coffee shops that will provide a deterministic view 
of the consumption of the beverage in the select regions.

The next step will be to find an optimal location for the shop to be set up so that
	-> it will be a successful venture.
	-> will not have to face the extensive competition due to previously established businesses.

The dataset utilized here is the same Toronto and New-York dataset that has been used in previous weeks.
