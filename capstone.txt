Introduction :

The business problem is to figure out an optimum location for a new outlet for coffee shop in a locality.

Data utilised here is :
	list of localities preferred by the user;
	location data from geocoding api; 
	nearby information from the foursquare api;

Methodology:
	The location data is outsourced to the foursquare api
	to figure out the concentraion of coffee shops in a region,larger the number larger the demand in the zone.
	The Zillow api features the property rates and nearby available properties.

Results:
	The program facilitates the user with possible locations in the neighborhood for setting up the business.

Future improvements :
	The program can be tweaked a little more to actually pinpoint to the most optimum location with lowest prices.
	However, there are logistical and sociological factors that it may not be able to predict in every case.
